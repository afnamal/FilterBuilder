## ðŸ§° React Filter Builder

This component allows users to dynamically build complex filter sets with support for:
- Text, number, date, and boolean filters
- Conditional operators like `eq`, `ne`, `contains`, `between`, etc.
- Grouped filtering using `AND` / `OR` logic
- Auto-handling of URL search parameters via React Router
- Built with React, MUI, React Hook Form, and i18next

Ideal for admin dashboards, search pages, and data grids with advanced filtering needs.
